# 15 Puzzle Solver (A* Search)

This project is a Python implementation of the **15 Puzzle Solver** using the A* search algorithm with the **Manhattan distance heuristic**.

## 📌 About the 15 Puzzle

The 15 puzzle is a sliding tile game played on a 4x4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and one empty space (represented as `0` in this project).  
The goal is to arrange the numbers in order from 1 to 15, with the blank tile in the bottom-right corner.

## 🔁 Example Start and End Board
<pre>
Start Board       |    End Board
6   2   3   4     |    1   2   3   4
1   9  10   7     |    5   6   7   8
13  5   0   8     |    9  10  11  12
11 14  15  12     |    13 14  15   0
</pre>

## 🚀 Features

- Solves any valid (solvable) 15-puzzle board using A* search
- Uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic for tile positioning
- Prints each step of the solution in the terminal so you can follow along
- Displays total move count and solve time
- Adjustable difficulty by changing shuffle depth

```

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

- **Heuristic (h)**: Sum of Manhattan distances between each tile and its goal spot.
- **Cost (g)**: Number of moves taken so far.
- **Total (f = g + h)**: This score decides which board gets explored next.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you’re using Python 3. Then just run:

```bash
python3 solver.py
