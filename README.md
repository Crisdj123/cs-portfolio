# Cristian Jimenez - Computer Science & Data Portfolio
Welcome!
This portfolio highlights my work as a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, with a focus on data analytics and data engineering.

## About Me
My background in computer science gives me a strong foundation in problem-solving and logic, which I apply to data-focused work such as querying, organizing datasets, and using data to support better decisions.

## Projects:
### Checkers AI (Python + TensorFlow)  
A two-player Checkers game where the user plays against an AI powered by a trained TensorFlow model. Includes king promotion, jump logic, and ASCII board rendering. [→ View project folder](./checkers-ai-tensorflow)


### 15 Puzzle Solver (Python + A* Search)  
Tile sliding puzzle solved using A* with Manhattan distance. 
Clean Python implementation and visual solution steps.
