# Cristian Jimenez - Computer Science & Data Portfolio
Welcome!
This portfolio highlights my work as a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, with a focus on data analytics and data engineering.

## About Me
My background in computer science gives me a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, which I apply to data-focused work such as querying, organizing datasets, and using data to support better decisions.

## Projects:

### IMDb Data Analysis Project (SQL + PostgreSQL)
Designed and queried a relational database using real-world IMDb datasets.
Performed SQL analysis using JOINs, aggregations, and filters to explore ratings, genres, and trends over time.
