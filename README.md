# Cristian's CS Portfolio
Welcome! This a collection of my personal and team projects showing my skills in game development, AI, and Python.

## 📌 About Me
I'm a **Computer Science major** at Kennesaw State University, focused on game development and artificial intelligence. 

I'm preparing to transfer to Georgia Tech, and this portfolio reflects both my growth and passion for building things I love.
